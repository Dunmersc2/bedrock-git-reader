This code is a Python script that uses the boto3 library to copy a file from one S3 bucket to another, potentially across different accounts. The script creates a boto3 session using the provided AWS access key and secret key, and then uses the session to create an S3 resource. The script then copies the file using the bucket.copy() method, and prints a success message if the copy is successful. If the copy fails, the script raises an exception.
